### I am a member of the SHFT group
At SHFT, we are working to improve methods for big data analysis on hetergenious datasets, and the archival and emulation works of past game and mulimedia projects.

A writer can be a programmer, but can a programmer be a writer?

### Coatirane Adventures (<img src="python.png" width="20" height="20"></img>)

Coatirane Adventures is my true passion and where almost all of my time ends up getting funneled. It is built inside a custom fork of [Kivy](https://github.com/eman1can/kivy)<img src="kivy.png" width="20" height="20"></img>. The game itself will be unpublished and a work of passion until I can manage to obtain enough funding and time to finish creating all custom artwork and animations for the game as well as adding many features that I would like. The game draws heavy inspiration from the light novel series Danmachi and its associated mobile game.
Starting in the small town of Coatirane, recruit adventurers to join your cause and explore a dangerous dungeon to gain strength and rewards.

### Wolf Reader

Wolf Reader is the actualization of the combining of Kindle and Calibre. I love the reading interface of the Kindle and the ease of use that my Fire allowed really drew me back into reading, but after awhile the horible organization of the Kindle Reader and the inability to read outside books or even books on the device pushed me towards the Calibre Companion app, but for all its features, it only has a limit of ten books and doesn't contain its own reader. This doesn't relieve my frustration with kindle's statistics either. This, I have embarked upon the created of Wolf Reader where I take the simplicity of Kindle, and the organization of Calibre to combine them in to a simple and satifactory reading experience. Current involed on actualizing the pagination algorithm of Android to both work on older systems, and be more specialized to the use case of literarry display, I am building the system from the ground up to hold the virtures of being quick, simple, and dependable.
