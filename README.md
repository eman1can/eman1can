## Currently working on

### Coatirane Adventures (<img src="python.png" width="20" height="20"></img>)
Built using a custom fork of [Kivy](https://github.com/eman1can/kivy)<img src="kivy.png" width="20" height="20"></img> that adds hovering and asyncronous loading of S3 objects and to be compiled on Windows, Linux, Mac and Android.
Starting in the small town of Coatirane, recruit adventurers to join your cause and explore a dangerous dungeon to gain strength and rewards.
Draws heavy inspiration from the light novel series Danmachi and its associated mobile game.

Built on a custom porting of Spine and Lwf for character and fighting animations.
This is the masterpiece of my college education, in the making since winter break of 2018. I am using python, as in 2018 I really wanted to teach myself python, and decided that making a game would be a fun but powerful way to do so.
At first, I started to create my project using TKinter while skiing in Mammoth Lakes with my Family. I just started to tinker (see what I did there? :p) with creating a small UI start screen and choosing a character until I realized that TKinter doesn't support alpha channel images (or something using transparency that it couldn't handle). I then poked around the GUI's using python and was starting to lose hope in making a game when I stumbled up Kivy. It promised to do everything I needed that TKinter couldn't and everything else as well. It was the whole kitchen sink.
Now, after having taken an app development class, I can absolutely, positivley say that I started to make my game in the most horried, inefficient way possible. I started by creating the UI screen and by creating the workflow that a user might go through in polaying the game. Three years later, and while I have a whole UI where I can select characters to play as, get new characters, and almost change equipment and level characters, I can't actually play the game itself. Part of that reason is because of the complexity of the game engine itself that I am making. The other part is because I started the project in the wrong direction. had I started with the animation libraries and the core of the gameplay, I might have a actually playable game at this point, although I am sure that I would have lost enthusiam in the project at some point. You could actually say that I do have a playable game state right now, as currently you can walk around as the character and fight enemies, but there are no fighting animations, and there are no backgrounds. I am currently working on integrating the fighting animations and am really close to being done. Once I finish the fighting animations I plan to fully flush out the core game of fighting, and then integrate all the character leveling and equipment.
Another part of why I haven't come that far in three whole years is that I have also chosen to undertake the ardous task of rewriting my whole code base multiple (more like 5-7) times when I either learn new information or learn that I was doing something horribly wrong. This has resulted in slow progress, but of the progress that I have made, I am extremly happy with the state of my code. I am currently however in the progress of yet another rewrite where I reorganize my code much better and use much more safe and clean ways of jumping around in my code. This is in part of the code that I am writing for the animations.
The biggest part of why development is slow however, is that I am BUSY with school, taking 5-6 classes every single sememester, which is why I plan to have only 1-2 classes alongside my capstone so that I can really put 300% effort into it and deveote my every waking hour without worrying about falling behind in my classes.
