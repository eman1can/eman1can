### Coatirane Adventures (<img src="python.png" width="20" height="20"></img>)

Coatirane Adventures is my true passion and where almost all of my time ends up getting funneled. It is built inside a custom fork of [Kivy](https://github.com/eman1can/kivy)<img src="kivy.png" width="20" height="20"></img>. The game itself will be unpublished and a work of passion until I can manage to obtain enough funding and time to finish creating all custom artwork and animations for the game as well as adding many features that I would like. The game draws heavy inspiration from the light novel series Danmachi and its associated mobile game.
Starting in the small town of Coatirane, recruit adventurers to join your cause and explore a dangerous dungeon to gain strength and rewards.
