You can look at me on [here](https://ethanwolfe.myftp.biz) for more information or to contact me!

Current reading goal of the year is 300 books!
I also have a goal to get my perfect games up to fifty!
This is on top of finishing my capstone, graduating, and finding a job.

### I am a member of the SHFT group
At SHFT, we are working to improve methods for big data analysis on hetergenious datasets, and the archival and emulation works of past game and mulimedia projects.

### Coatirane Adventures (<img src="python.png" width="20" height="20"></img>)

Coatirane Adventures is my true passion and where almost all of my time ends up getting funneled. It is built inside a custom fork of [Kivy](https://github.com/eman1can/kivy)<img src="kivy.png" width="20" height="20"></img>. The game itself will be unpublished and a work of passion until I can manage to obtain enough funding and time to finish creating all custom artwork and animations for the game as well as adding many features that I would like. The game draws heavy inspiration from the light novel series Danmachi and its associated mobile game.
Starting in the small town of Coatirane, recruit adventurers to join your cause and explore a dangerous dungeon to gain strength and rewards.

### Wolf Reader

Wolf Reader is a side project for me. A fully features ebook reader, it will include page turning, page counts and many other advanced fatures. I plan to release it solely on Android, and I started development due to the fact that I love the Kindle Fire App, but I hate how closed to ecosystem is, and want to add in lots of QOL improvements and functionality expansions. I am currently struggling with achieveing a good balance of loading in the background and a first loading time. Sadly, however I want to meet my reading goal of the year before I commit too much time to the project.

### Goliath

The Golaith is a monolithic book series, contianing at the least, 6 or 7 full sized books. There are also a large number of spin off stories and branches that I would also love to explore. This book series is even older than Coatirane Adventures and I began planning and writing the series in 2015. I am currently writing one of the main spin-off books and using it as inspiration and experience for writing the first books of the main storyline.
